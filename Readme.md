##### This is the first time that I am using selenium, it's a fun little application that does the following...

1. Finds a post from the top posts on twitter :white_check_mark:
2. Verifies that it is long enough otherwise it will search again :white_check_mark:
3. Translates it into bad english :white_check_mark:
4. Logs into to twitter :white_check_mark:
5. Makes the post :white_check_mark:

*There is also a cute little GUI and executable for this application so that i can run it from my local machine instead of the IDE*

### Sometimes it's nice to stop doing the serious codin' (no g) for a little while and make something which is genuinely fun, this is that application.

# :shipit: This was a really fun one :shipit:
